    "full_text": "Hi everyone, in this class, we will be learning about basic sorting. What does sorting mean? It means arranging things in a particular order. For example, we have seen dictionaries in which all our words are arranged alphabetically, first starting with A, then B, then C. Another example is when we see two types of dustbins in houses, parks, or other places, where the blue dustbin is for non-biodegradable things and the green dustbin is for biodegradable things like fruits. In this way, we separate and arrange items based on their type. Similarly, in school, we used to stand in line height-wise, which was also a particular arrangement. Sorting, therefore, is arranging things in a specific order — whether increasing, decreasing, or any other defined order. In real life, sorting is used in many places. For instance, on Amazon, if you want to see items with a 5-star or 4-star rating, you are sorting products based on ratings. Similarly, when booking tickets, you might want to see prices from low to high or high to low. Sorting helps in all these scenarios. In this lesson, we will cover some basic sorting techniques. First, we will discuss bubble sort, then selection sort, insertion sort, and finally counting sort, which is slightly more advanced. The first three are basic techniques, while counting sort is more advanced. There are also other sorting techniques based on recursion and backtracking, which we will discuss in upcoming lessons. Along with this lesson, I have attached a very helpful PDF that summarizes sorting techniques — including the time and memory each one takes. It also includes useful information about data structures. You can refer to it whenever you revise."
