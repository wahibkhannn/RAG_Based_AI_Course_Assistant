The benefit will be that you have made a code Which automatically calculates sum for you And you can enter any value of your numbers So let's do this code To write code we have imported our package Means we have to write this line If we want to use scanner Means if we want to take any input After that we will write scanner sc is equal to new scanner system.in First of all we will take input variable Integer a is equal to sc.nextint After that we will take input variable b sc.nextint I hope we are getting this sc.nextint After that we will make a third variable sum What values are going to be written in sum? A plus b value And finally we will print System.out.printlnsum Let's save this and run it First of all we have to enter a value We have entered a as 10 Then we will enter b value We have entered b as 5 After that what happened? For us sum was calculated 10 plus 5 is equal to 15 That variable will be made in memory And then sum was printed for us on the screen Which is given as 15 If we want we can put any other value Instead of a and b If we want instead of integer We can take float We are summing floating values So we have made a full fledged program Our first program In which we are taking input values In which we are doing some calculation In which we have defined variables And in which we have shown some output So this is a big success in programming If you have understood how we have written the code How we have taken input and output How we have defined variables How we have assigned values If you have understood this much Then we are doing a great job in programming Because logically understanding this is a big thing So congratulations And I hope we have understood this well And in the same way We will be building a lot of logic in the coming programs"
