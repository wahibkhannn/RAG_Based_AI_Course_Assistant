  "full_text": "Hi everyone, in this class, we will be learning about basic sorting. What does sorting mean?
It means arranging things in a particular order.
For example, we have seen dictionaries in which all our words are arranged alphabetically.
First, starting with A, then B, then C.
Or if we have seen two types of dustbins in the house, in parks or other places,
where the blue dustbin is for non-biodegradable things and the green dustbin is for biodegradable things like fruits.
So, in this way, we arranged non-biodegradable and biodegradable things in an order.
Or we used to stand in school height-wise.
So, it was a particular arrangement based on height.
So, if we arrange things in an order, it can be an increasing order, a decreasing order, or any other order.
We call it sorting.
In real life, sorting is used in many places.
If you go to Amazon and you want to see an item with a 5-star rating or a 4-star rating,
then you will be sorting those items according to the rating.
Or you want the price to be high from low or low from high.
When we go to book tickets, the price should be high from low to high.
So, we use sorting in real life.
So, in this lesson, we will talk about some basic sorting techniques.
First, we will talk about bubble sort, then selection sort, then insertion sort, and finally counting sort, which is a little advanced.
These three are very basic.
This is our advanced sorting technique.
There are other sorting techniques that are based on recursion and backtracking.
We will talk about them in the upcoming lessons.
Right now, we will be studying these four.
Along with this, I have attached a PDF for you.
It is a very famous PDF.
It helps a lot in remembering which sorting technique takes how much memory and how much time.
You will also get a lot of information about the data structures.
You can refer that whenever you are going to revise."
